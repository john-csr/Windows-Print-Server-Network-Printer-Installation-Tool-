| **Remote Management**     | PowerShell remoting via `-ComputerName`                                 |
| **Dependencies**          | PowerShell 5+, WinRM, ActiveX (WScript.Shell), Printer Drivers          |
| **Output Format**         | Text rendered in `<textarea>` elements                                  |

## Security Considerations

- **Execution Policy**: Uses `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` to ensure command execution; should be restricted to trusted environments.
- **Administrative Rights**: Required for printer and port management.
- **PowerShell Remoting**: Ensure WinRM is enabled and secured on target servers.
- **Input Validation**: Minimal input sanitization; production use should include stricter validation.
- **Logging**: No built-in logging; recommend integrating with event logs or external logging tools.

## Use Case Scenarios

### 1. **Printer Deployment**
Install network printers remotely by specifying server, IP port, share name, and driver.

### 2. **Port Auditing**
Query existing printer ports to identify unused or misconfigured entries.

### 3. **Driver Inventory**
List installed drivers to verify compatibility or prepare for upgrades.

### 4. **Connectivity Testing**
Ping IP addresses to validate network reachability before installation.

### 5. **Printer Inventory**
Generate a list of all printers installed on a server for documentation or troubleshooting.
